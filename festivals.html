            <h2>Land of festivals</h2>
            <p>Punjabi festivals are various festive celebrations observed by the Punjabis, originating in the Punjab
                region. The Punjabis are religiously a diverse and that affects the festivals they observe. According to
                a 2007 estimate, a total of ~75% percent of the Punjabi population is Muslim, accounting about 90
                million people, with 97% of Punjabis who live in Pakistan following Islam, in contrast to the remaining
                30 million Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus who predominantly live in India.[1]

                The Punjabi Muslims typically observe the Islamic festivals, do not observe Hindu or Sikh religious
                festivals, and in Pakistan the official holidays recognize only the Islamic festivals.[2][3] The Punjabi
                Sikhs and Hindus typically do not observe these, and instead observe historic festivals such as Lohri,
                Basant and Vaisakhi as seasonal festivals.[4] The Sikh and Hindu festivals are regional official
                holidays in India, as are major Islamic festivals.[5] Other seasonal Punjabi festivals in India include
                Teejon (Teeyan) and Maghi.[4] Teeyan is also known as festival of women, as women enjoy it with their
                friends. On the day of maghi people fly kites and eat their traditional dish khichdi.</p>
